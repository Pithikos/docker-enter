Description: Similar to nsenter. The difference is that it is docker
             oriented. It adds functionality by letting the user enter
             a container by giving the container ID (uses docker).

             It also let's the user to directly enter a specific dire-
             ctory and enter the container as a specific user (the user
             must exist in the container).
